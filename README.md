# framing-and-sentiment-telegram
Framing, propaganda, and sentiment analysis of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian Telegram channels around the 2025 Zelensky–Trump meeting.

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline for my Master’s thesis, which investigates how pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian Telegram channels framed the 2025 Zelensky–Trump meeting and how audiences responded in their comments. It combines manual coding of frames and propaganda techniques, transformer-based sentiment analysis, and BERTopic topic modeling to explore narrative construction and audience emotional dynamics.
